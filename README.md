# Computer Vision Project
This repository contains the implementation and resources for the **Computer Vision Course Project**. The project focuses on [briefly describe the project's main objective, e.g., "developing a convolutional neural network for image classification"].

## Repository Contents

- **Code.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Dataset/**: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **model_augmented.pt**: Saved PyTorch model weights after training with data augmentation.
- **Course+Project-2023.pdf**: Project description and guidelines provided for the course.

## Project Overview

[Provide a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and significance. For example:]

The goal of this project is to [e.g., "classify images into predefined categories using deep learning techniques"]. The model is trained on the provided dataset and evaluated to assess its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `Dataset/` directory. It consists of [describe the dataset, e.g., "images categorized into different classes representing various objects"].

## Model Architecture

[Describe the architecture of the model used. For example:]

The implemented model is a [e.g., "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"] comprising:

- [Layer 1: e.g., "Convolutional layer with 32 filters and ReLU activation"]
- [Layer 2: e.g., "MaxPooling layer with a 2x2 window"]
- [Continue describing layers as appropriate]

## Training and Evaluation

- **Data Augmentation**: [Describe any data augmentation techniques applied, e.g., "Random rotations, flips, and normalization were applied to enhance model generalization."]
- **Training**: The model was trained using [e.g., "the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for 20 epochs"].
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance was assessed using [e.g., "accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score"].
